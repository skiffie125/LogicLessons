        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After all of this learning, I would ask that you all take a step back and reflect. The goal of this course is to help make the connection between making and understanding. But as we know there are limits to both. There are limits to how much logic can do for us. Logic is a way of modeling the world and models are extremely helpful. But they are imperfect. At the start of this course, I asked you to write about your experiences of logic. I will now ask you to look for a time when logic was not solely enough.  </p>
        <h3>Thank you for taking the time to do this course.  </h3>
