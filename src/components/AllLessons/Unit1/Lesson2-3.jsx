    <h1>Responsibility  </h1>
    <p>Responsibility is not an easy topic. It has many corollaries, for example blame and duty, but rarely is it put into the context of creation.  </p>
    <h3>Philosophy </h3>
    <p>Tech companies often refer to themselves as disruptors, changing the way we live our lives. But there are costs to changing things. The most common philosophical question when it comes to personal responsibility vs public good is the trolley problem. </p>
    <p>The trolley problem is a common philosophical question most people already know. A trolley is running down a track at an unstoppable speed, there are 5 people on its current path, and one on an alternate path you could divert the trolley to. Do you divert the trolley, killing one, or do you let it go on itâ€™s current path, killing 5. Different ethical frameworks have different answers to this question, and so do people.  </p>
    <p>This is a simple thought experiment but its variations are too numerous to name. Some have loved ones on the tracks, questioning what are you willing to give up personally to do good for others. Others make judgements on the type of people on the tracks, criminals versus saints. Others still ask about the diversion itself, how hard it is, or do you have to sacrifice yourself.  </p>
    <p>For practice, design a trolley problem that makes you unsure if what you would decide to do.  </p>
    <h3>Computer Science </h3>
    <p>Responsibility covers a large spread of topics with the emergence of new technology. The broadest by far is effects it has on others. In the last decade, technology has radically shifted our lives. Many of us use an application, a website or a piece of physical technology daily that did not exist 2 years ago. These technologies do have impacts on us, though because of the rate of change, it can be hard to study. The impacts can also extend beyond the personal. Things like power consumption, security, materials, military forces, and economies are all affected by the emergence of new technology, to name a few.  </p>
    <p>Practice: Research your favorite technology for the impacts it's had, both positive and negative.  </p>
    <h3>Intersection  </h3>
    <p>Compare the impacts of new technologies with our talk of responsibility previously.  </p>
    <p>How should tech advancements be made? </p>
    <p>Where does the responsibility lie for the impacts of new technology?  </p>
